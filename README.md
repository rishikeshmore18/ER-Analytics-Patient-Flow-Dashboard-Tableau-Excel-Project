## 🎯 Objective

To analyze ER visitation trends, patient demographics, wait times, and satisfaction levels in order to:
- Optimize resource allocation
- Reduce patient wait times
- Improve operational efficiency
- Enhance patient satisfaction

---

## 📌 Target Stakeholders
- **Hospital Administrators**: To enhance staffing, resource allocation, and patient flow.
- **Healthcare Policymakers**: To support data-driven policy and emergency care planning.
- **Medical Researchers**: To investigate patient behavior and care disparities in emergency rooms.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: data.world
- **Scope**: 9,216 emergency room visits
- **Variables**: Age, Gender, Race, Wait Times, Satisfaction Scores, Visit Time, Department Referrals

---

## 🔍 Core Analysis Themes

### 1. Visitor Trends & Seasonality
- **25% drop in August**: Likely due to vacations, low disease prevalence, and fewer child injuries.
- **35% peak in December**: Resulting from winter illnesses and holiday-related activity.

### 2. Wait Time Dynamics
- **Shortest Wait**: Saturday 2 PM (~35 mins)
- **Longest Wait**: Friday 1 AM (~42 mins)
- **Afternoons generally smoother**, while early AM hours are most strained.

### 3. Demographic Patterns
- **Ages 19–50**: Most frequent ER visitors
- **Ages 51–65**: Moderate
- **Seniors 65+**: Least visits, raising accessibility concerns

### 4. Satisfaction vs. Wait Times
- High correlation: Longer wait = Lower satisfaction
- **Mean satisfaction**: 5.03/10
- **Average wait**: 38.97 minutes (±15 mins)
